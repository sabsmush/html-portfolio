<h2>Sabrina - 1954 Original Film</h2>
<p style="font-style: italic;">The original Sabrina movie is a romantic comedy film released in 1954, directed by Billy Wilder and starring Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, and William Holden. The movie tells the story of Sabrina Fairchild (Audrey Hepburn), the daughter of a wealthy family's chauffeur, who has been infatuated with David Larrabee (William Holden), a playboy son of her employer, all her life.</p>

<p>The reason this is my favorite film is because this is how my parents chose my name. They were inspired by Audrey Hepburns class and how she carried herself. It was also an uncommon name at the time, so they wanted something unique, but easy to pronounce.</p>
<h2>Cheaper by the Dozen - 2003 Version</h2>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Tom (Steve Martin) and Kate Baker (Bonnie Hunt) have compromised their careers to raise 12 children. Tom coaches a high-school football team, while Kate has retired from journalism to raise the family. Things change when Tom is offered a college coaching job in a new city at the same time a publisher buys Kate's parenting memoir. After moving, Kate goes on a book tour, leaving Tom in charge of the children, who -- already unhappy about relocating -- plunge the household into chaos.</p>
<p>I have always loved this movie for a variety of reasons. One being I enjoy the aspect of getting to experience what having a big family would be like. Coming from a small family, I have always wondered what it would be like to have 12 brothers and sisters.</p>
